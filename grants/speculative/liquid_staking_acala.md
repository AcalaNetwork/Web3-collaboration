# Acala Liquid Staking Protocol by Acala Foundation
Acala Foundation nurtures and stewards applications in the fields of decentralized finance protocols particularly those that can serve as open finance building blocks such as stable currency and liquid staking. Acala Liquid Staking Protocol (Homa Protocol) is the second focal R&D project after stablecoin initiated by the Acala Foundation. The Acala Foundation is founded by [Laminar](https://laminar.one/) and [Polkawallet](https://polkawallet.io/) both of whom are contributors to the Polkadot ecosystem. 

## Project Description
Polkadot network targets 50% active DOT staking with a 20% annual return. Effectively this creates an opportunity cost for using DOT in other applications versus staking. Ethereum as it currently stands as a PoW network has no such barrier, and in fact, has an incentive for ETH holder to participate in DeFi applications like MakerDAO or Compound. On the other hand, if DeFi lending applications provide a better yield than staking, it could motivate the collective movement of funds from staking to lending, causing a 'bank run' and risking the security of the entire network.

We are building a trustless protocol (Homa Protocol) to solve the illiquidity challenge of staked assets. The Homa Protocol is generalized to support tokenizing any staked assets as L-Token (as Liquid Asset), and its initial implementation will support tokenizing staked DOT as L-DOT. Users can trustlessly stake through the protocol, enjoys staking rewards with optimized staking strategies, have the option for early or immediate unbounding liquidity, while using the fungible L-Token to trade, collateralize for stablecoin, or else. In the era of PoS networks, the Homa Protocol will serve as a critical financial primitive alongside with stablecoin to power more open finance applications.

The Homa Protocol will contain the following parts
- An economic model for managing the staking pool and liquidity pool, to maximize staking reward, while provision for slashes and early unbounding liquidity
- The first liquid staking product: LDOT or Liquid DOT 
- Various runtime modules to manage staking pool, parachain delegated staking, redemption strategies
- A Homa Council to govern this protocol such as managing staking strategies
- Extend the Acala SDK to include support for the Homa Protocol to empower the developer community to build upon and integrate with this protocol 
- Extend the Acala dApp to enable staking through Homa protocol, minting LDOT and redemption of DOT, and governance etc.

## Development Roadmap
`The Homa Liquid Staking Protocol` will be a 3-month project, aims to deliver a production-ready liquid staked asset Liquid DOT with trustless staking protocol and council governance on Acala's Testnet. We will also implement the economic model to manage staking rewards, slashes, early liquidity premium etc. 

* **M1: Implementation of the Homa Protocol (4 weeks)**
  - we will implement these modules: 
    - `homa`: management module for the protocol, handler for minting and redemption of LDOT
    - `homa_treasury`: manages revenues from the protocol, slash provision strategy e.g. validators to deposit slash warranty to compensate slash lost
    - `staking_pool`: to track staking status, account for staking rewards, slashes etc, manage a queue of unbonding assets throughout eras, and liquid pool etc.
  - develop and implement an early unbonding premium algorithm - this is key to the economics of the protocol
  - we will perform runtime upgrade on Acala testnet to include these functionalities, and provide relevant documentation for the community
  - we will deliver a running chain with these modules, docker image to set up an Acala node, an SDK library, and a tutorial using this protocol

* **M2: Implementation of Governance & dApp Design (4 weeks)**
  - we will set up Honzon council governance and implement `nominees_election` module, to allow LDOT holders to vote for nominators, also consider implementing more sophisticated algorithm such as phragmen
  - we will implement a simple strategy to allow LDOT holders to participate in Polkadot governance e.g. parachain delegated voting for proposals and councilors
  - we will complete UX design for the LDOT flow and integration with stablecoin functionalities e.g. using LDOT as collateral
  - we will perform runtime upgrade on Acala testnet to include these functionalities, and provide relevant documentation for the community
  - we will deliver a running chain with these modules, docker image to set up an Acala node, an SDK library, and a tutorial using this protocol
  
* **M3: Implementation of Polkadot Bridge for Delegated Staking & dApp (4 weeks)**
  - we will integrate with Polkadot bridge, and able to perform token transfers, parachain bond/unbond, withdraw, payout etc. this could be the full xcmp integration, or simplified bridge or a mock bridge depending on the situation, nevertheless, we will be able to complete the flow
  - we will perform runtime upgrade on Acala testnet to include these functionalities, a running chain with a docker image, an SDK plus tutorials and relevant documentation will be available for the community
  - we will implement a web dApp to include these features: stake DOT, mint LDOT, redeem LDOT, track earnings, vote for nominators, allow validators to deposit slash warranty etc. 
  - we will deliver a working web application with these features, and a tutorial to use it

**Dependent Components (ideal to have but not compulsory)**
- the inter-chain communication protocol for Polkadot is available, and a cross-chain token standard is formalized
- Cumulus is ready to run parachain collector nodes

## Additional Information
* Work has been done so far
  1. We are drafting and verifying the economic model and algorithm for LDOT and early unbounding premium
  2. We have created a proof-of-concept runtime modules for LDOT and related functionalities

* Are there any teams who have already contributed (financially) to the project? 
  So far this project is funded by Acala Pte.

* Have you applied for other grants so far? 
  Acala has received a w3f grant re stablecoin, all milestones in [the application](https://github.com/w3f/General-Grants-Program/blob/master/grants/speculative/stablecoin_acala.md) have been delivered and approved by w3f grants team. 

  Members of the Acala Foundation, both Polkawallet and Laminar are w3f grant recipients for their respective projects. 

* Are there any other projects similar to yours? If so, how is your project different? 
Centralized exchanges such as Binance and Bitfinex deliver some of the desirable functionalities including trading balances of staked tokens and early unbounding. But they are centralized. 

Chorus One has a delegated voucher system, but in their design different delegated voucher exist for different validators, hence different from Acala's fungible liquid staked asset. 

Everett (building on Cosmos) uses a MakerDAO like over-collateralization synthetic pegging approach to tokenizing the staked assets. The challenge is that the value of their own network token will need to be high enough for the security required.

Stafi is designed to support multiple PoS networks via multi-sig approach to authorize the delegation, while Acala is the fully trustless alternative. Stafi (in their [whitepaper](https://docs.stafi.io/)) uses their own token as security and a bond token for staked assets which is more like a NFT.

Acala offers a fully decentralized solution with on-chain governance. Chorus One has produced a Liquid Staking research paper (draft [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eP2w_pZEZlSbKDHqG-Zf5cZXbk2ZH4BWFEqu-KeoGeQ/edit?usp=sharing)), which analyses different approaches to the problem, and recognizes Acala as one of the solutions.
